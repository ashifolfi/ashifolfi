- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Ash here! I'm interested in programming applications and games.
- The languages I know how to code in are **Objective C, JS, Qt, C++, C, CSS, HTML, ZScript, and Lua**.
- I'm not looking to collaborate on just anything. If I want to help with your project I'll contact you.
- ðŸ“« Aside from that you can find me at these places:
  - @RazzDaze on Twitter (I don't frequently check my DMs)
  - @ashi@meow.social on Mastodon
  - <insert untypable discord tag> (Highest chance of getting a response)
